Common tools and utilities for Unity projects.

This package is a collection of tools and utilities that I have developed over the years to help me with my Unity projects. It is a work in progress, and is not intended to be a complete (or stable) solution, but rather a collection of tools that I have found useful. Understand that I am not a professional developer, and that my code may not be the best or most efficient way to do things. I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Prerequisites

This package relies heavily on [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/), which is not included in this package. You will need to install it separately.
